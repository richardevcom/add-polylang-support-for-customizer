## Features

-   Language switcher in Customizer.
-   Localized theme_mods and options for both default and custom made Customizer values.
-   Enable/disable forcing _“The language is set from content”_ setting in `Language` > `Settings` > `URL modifications`

## Prerequisite

1. Polylang must be installed and activated.
2. Languages must be set in **Admin > Languages**.
3. _If you have a static front page_:
    1. _Create a front page per each language._
    2. _Select the front page in **Admin > Settings > Reading** per language._
4. Expect customizer to use setting type = `theme_mod` (default) as in:

`$wp_customize->add_setting( 'setting_id', [ 'type' => 'theme_mod', ] );`

## Installation

This plugin can be installed directly into your plugins folder "as-is"<br/>
or:

-   go to **Plugins > Add new** and type in Search `Add Polylang support for Customizer` and click **Install** and then **Activate** buttons.
-   if you go to **Admin panel > Plugins > Add new > Upload Plugin** and select the archive containing this plugin.

It's safe to activate the plugin at this point. Because the plugin just injects some functionality - there will be no plugin menus or settings to play with.
