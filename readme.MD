# Add Polylang support for Customizer

This plugin adds Polylang support for WordPress Customizer.

## Features

* Language switcher in Customizer.
* Localized theme_mods and options for both default and custom made Customizer values.

## Installation

This plugin can be installed directly into your plugins folder "as-is"<br/>
or if you go to **Admin panel > Plugins > Add new > Upload Plugin** and select the archive containing this plugin.

It's safe to activate the plugin at this point. Because the plugin just injects some functionality - there will be no plugin menus or settings to play with.
